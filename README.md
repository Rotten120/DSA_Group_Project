## About the Project

This project features a collection of DSA problems and solutions implemented by the group. The aim is to learn, implement, and optimize various data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.) in a collaborative setting.

## Features

- Implementation of classic data structures and algorithms
- Well-commented code for educational purposes
- Modular structure for easy expansion
- Sample problems and solutions
